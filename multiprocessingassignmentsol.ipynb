    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "Ans:- Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. \n",
    "Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently.\n",
    "The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system\n",
    "A multiprocessing system can have:\n",
    "multiprocessor, i.e. a computer with more than one central processor.\n",
    "multi-core processor, i.e. a single computing component with two or more independent actual processing units (called “cores”).\n",
    "Here, the CPU can easily executes several tasks at once, with each task using its own processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of the multiprocessing system are: Increased Throughput − By increasing the number of processors, \n",
    "more work can be completed in a unit time. Cost Saving − Parallel system shares the memory, buses, peripherals etc. \n",
    "Multiprocessor system thus saves money as compared to multiple single systems."

    "1.In Multiprocessing, CPUs are added for increasing computing power.\n",
    "While In Multithreading, many threads are created of a single process for increasing computing power.\n",
    "2.In Multiprocessing, Many processes are executed simultaneously.\n",
    "While in multithreading, many threads of a process are executed simultaneously.\n",
    "3.Multiprocessing are classified into Symmetric and Asymmetric.\n",
    "While Multithreading is not classified in any categories.\n",
    "4.In Multiprocessing, Process creation is a time-consuming process\n",
    ".While in Multithreading, process creation is according to economical.\n",
    "5.In Multiprocessing, every process owned a separate address space.\n",
    "While in Multithreading, a common address space is shared by all the threads."

    "Ans:-\n",

    "The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using\n",
    "subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors\n",
