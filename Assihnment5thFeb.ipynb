    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Solution:-\n",
    "All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.\n",
    "The use of the __init__() function  is to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary \n",
    "to do when the object is being created:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 = Person(\"John\", 36)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p1.name)  # output :- John\n",
    "print(p1.age)   # output :- age\n",
    "step1 : Person(\"John\", 36) - the reference flows to  “__init__(self, name, age)” where the parameters name =”john” and age =36\n",
    "after this name and age are attributes of the Person class and these attributes are being assigned parameter values.\n",
    "At last p1 is the object of class person created with these values.\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Solution:-\n",
    "Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods. \n",
    "Ex :- class Person:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.age = age\n",
    "Here Person is the class and the blueprint of future objects of this class\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.\n",
    "p1 = Person(\"John\", 36)\n",
    "here p1 is the object of user defined class Person\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

    "\n",
    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "Solution:- The four pillars of OOPs are :-\n",
    "•\tAbstraction.\n",
    "•\tEncapsulation.\n",
    "•\tInheritance.\n",
    "•\tPolymorphism.\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "Solution:- The self variable is used to represent the instance of the class which is often used in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "It works as a reference to the object. Python uses the self parameter to refer to instance attributes and methods of the class\n",

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Solution:-\n",
    "Inheritance is defined as the mechanism of inheriting the properties of the base class to the child class. \n",
    "Types of Inheritance depend upon the number of child and parent classes involved. There are Five types of inheritance in Python:\n",
